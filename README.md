# My Personal Configurations

This repo is my personal config files & stuffs on my primary laptop, including:

- Ruby Gem settings
- default rails settings
- zsh (yeah I just switched to [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh))
- default ruby command line preloads
- VIM plugins & other

Everytime I set up a server I'll no doubt clone my set there, makes it as easy-to-play.

## How to set up

Clone this repos to any place you want and then hit `install.sh` inside

	git clone git@github.com/hozaka/conf.git
	cd conf
	./install.sh

Enjoy!
